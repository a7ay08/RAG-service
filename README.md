# RAG-service
This project builds a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that crawls websites, creates text embeddings, retrieves relevant information using similarity search, and generates natural-language answers with FLAN-T5, ensuring accurate, source-based responses and automatic refusals when information is unavailable.
